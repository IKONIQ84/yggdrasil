	<p><b>Collective Point of Sale Solutions (COLLECTIVEPOS)</b> is Canada's leading private provider of merchant services with thousands of satisfied customers from coast to coast.
	</p>
	<p>Deregulation in the banking industry has made it possible for us to offer a merchant services alternative to retailers across the country. Our systems process all of the same cards that bank systems do, are available for sale or lease (as opposed to the perpetual rental program offered by the banks), allow merchants to save money or even make money from transaction processing, and offer debit ATM cash back as an option to their customers.
	</p>
	<p><b>COLLECTIVE</b>POS has emerged as a leader in the merchant services industry thanks to the experience of our management team and the strategic approach of the brightest and most experienced individuals in the merchant services industry. Our company philosophy is to deliver quality, leading edge products and first class merchant services at reasonable prices that deliver cost savings and the opportunity for additional profits to retailers across Canada. We guarantee industry leading service and support to our customers and always strive to exceed expectations.
