This file contains installation instructions for phpMyPrepaid

1) Untar the tar file into your webservers base directoy.
# cd /var/www/html or wherever it is on your server
# tar -xvf ../phpMyPrepaid-0.1.x.tar

2) create the radius db.  If you have it, you will need to drop
it or add the extra tables etc.

# mysql -u root -p < ./db_mysql.sql

3) Put dbconnect into your document root and rename it dbconnect.php
Edit it and add your username and password.


4) If you are using the 0.1.1 or 0.1.2 tarball, edit index.php and
comment out the first section (Between GET DESIGN DETAILS and HEADER
INFOTMATION).  This was a reminant of dhalbe-Admin.  You could also
create the table in the database using design.sql. 
(Starting with 0.1.3RC1, This has been removed.  the show settings 
option is still in config.inc.php but it is set to 0 by default.)

Edit config.inc.php and change the show settings var from 1 to 0.
we just got rid of that section anyway so the link would do nothing.

5) Fire up a web browser and point it at the phpMyPrepaid directory.
Now try to make a card.  If you get an fopen permissions warning, it
means that the webserver can't write to the directory and it needs to
do this to make the pdf.

(Dirty unsafe way to do this #chmod 666 test.pdf)

Better way, chown test.pdf to the webservers user and group and then
give the file owner write permissions.   

If you want to use the new quick print option, set your web server to
push .ppc files to the client.  This is done in /etc/mime.types
add
application/xml-external-parsed-entity  ppc
I am using a shell script on the client to parse this and send it to
a reciept printer.  The shell script is not yet included with this
distro as it has not yet been GPLed.  prehaps in RC2.  I am looking 
at writing a python client for printing.  I could use Active X for 
windows clients but I think that Active X is evil.

Now you should be up and running.
