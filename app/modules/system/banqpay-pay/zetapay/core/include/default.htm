<p>BanqPay is a new online payment service, that allows visitors to pay for services on auctions, classified sites, and personal web sites.<br><br>
<p>In contrast with other online payment services, we are focused on enabling payments using dynamic generated content and payments enabling the dynamic link on a content provider website. Deploying this method allows the content provider to control the access to a specific link, by time or/and number of visits.
<br><br>

<p>We have concluded our Alpha testing and as part of this project stage we studied actual performances, and combine various payments methods to deliver the final merchant service to content providers.<br><br>

<p>We are moving into the Beta testing phase. We are currently looking for 10 content merchants to participate in the Beta testing phase, if you are interested please contact <a href=mailto:tzetter@epnn.com>beta@epnn.com</a><br><br>

<p>The BanQpay project was commissioned by the ePaymentsnews Network <a href=http://www.epnn.com>(www.epnn.com)</a>, to handle content payment, subscriptions and purchase payments under one payment service.<br><br>
