							<?=$sitename?> provides users with escrow payment options to help things run smoothly.
							Buyers can set aside a specific amount of money into an escrow account on <?=$sitename?>, for a
							specific Seller. Both users can then view the payment in the escrow account, but only the Buyer
							can complete the payment, from the escrow account to the Seller. The Seller is the only person
							(other than <?=$sitename?> staff) who can cancel this escrow payment. This gives each party half
							of the control over the money in the escrow account.
							Once both parties are ready, the Buyer can transfer the money from the escrow account to the
							Seller. If the transaction is cancelled amicably, the Seller can cancel the escrow payment and the
							money will return to the Buyer's account. If there are any disputes over a project, <?=$sitename?>
							staff must be contacted before any money can be moved from the escrow account.
						</p>
						<p>
							<?=$sitename?> encourages its users to send and receive money with the escrow system, because it's
							another great way to make sure everyone gets what they want from a transaction.
