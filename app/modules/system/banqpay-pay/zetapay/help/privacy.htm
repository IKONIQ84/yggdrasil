INFORMATION WE COLLECT
<p>
Personal Information
<p>
We obtain and retain personal information that you give to us and certain related transactional information that we collect based on your use of any password-protected areas of our site or from the use of our Services. The following is a list of the primary methods by which we collection personal information.
<blockquote>
    <p>* Registration Information. To use the password protected areas of our site or our Services, you must establish an account with us. During registration, you are required to provide certain contact information (such as name and email address). As part of your registration, we may collect certain use preferences that you have for our site and Services. To comply with applicable law, we may require you to provide certain personal information, such as a social security number or drivers license number.<br>
    <p>* Transaction Information. When you load value to your account or make a purchase from an Merchant, we may collect various kinds of billing information about you including your name, email address, credit card number, third party account number (such as PayPal), bank account number, home and business addresses, and home and business phone numbers. We also may collect purchasing information such as the identity of the Merchant, order information, date, and transaction amount.<br>
    <p>* Information from Other Sources. We may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with our account information. For example, we may use commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about new products or services that we think will be of interest to you. In some circumstances for risk management purposes, we may collect background information about you and your business from a credit bureau or business information service.<br>
    <p>* Submissions and Customer Service. From time-to-time we may post surveys on our site. The surveys may request demographic information and customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to participate and disclose information. Such survey information will be used to improve the overall experience on our Services and our site. Also, we may collect information that identifies you personally when you submit comments, questions or suggestions to our customer service department.<br>
    <p>* Public Forums. The site may have chat rooms, discussion boards, online forums and other interactive technologies that allow individual comments and messages to be tied to a guest's name or email address. Any information you post in such forums is public information and we cannot control what uses third parties may make of personal information you share in such forums.<br>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Usage Information</b><br>
<p>When you use our site or Services, we may automatically collect certain types of information related to such use.
<blockquote>
    <p>* Traffic Information. We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, we may collect various types of "clickstream" information which is information about your browsing behavior, such as IP address information, entry and exit points for the site, search terms, Web site addresses you visit, page views, and impressions. Information also may be automatically collected through the use of "cookies" and "web beacons" which are discussed in more detail below.<br>
    <p>* Cookies. Cookies are small files placed on your hard drive by a web site when you visit. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when you return to the site, the site knows who you are and can personalize your visit. In general, we use cookies to collect information so that we can determine how to improve our site and services by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular; to personalize the site and make recommendations based on products you have liked in the past, as well as to improve the site experience; and to complete transactions you have requested. Advertisers that serve ads on our site may also use their own cookies. Such outside cookies are governed by the privacy policies of the entities placing the ads, and are not subject to this Policy. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of our site available to the general public but you may not be able to use some of the site's features or our services and you may have a less satisfactory experience.<br>
    <p>* Web Beacons. We may use Web beacons on our site or other sites and may permit third parties to place them on our site to monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes. A Web beacon, also known as a "Web bug," is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an email message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a site. Web beacons are often invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document or email message. Web beacons are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page; users may be able to click on "view profiles" of the web page to see whether the page is using a web beacon. Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons can also be linked to personal information. For example, advertising networks use Web bugs to add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile. Another use of Web bugs is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular Web site. Web bugs are also used to gather statistics about Web browser usage at different places on the Internet.

BanQpay does not intentionally collect any personal information from children.<br><br>

<p><b>Non-Personal information</b><br>

Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our user's needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our site.<br><br>

<p><b>OUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br><br>

<p><b>Internal Use</b><br>
In general, we use personal information internally to serve our users and to enhance and extend our relationship with our users. For example, by understanding how you use the site from your computer, we are able to customize and personalize your experience. More specifically, we use personal information to complete transactions you have requested, to anticipate and resolve problems with our site, to respond to customer support inquiries, and to send you periodic email newsletters (provided you register to receive our newsletter).

<p><b>Disclosure to Third Parties</b><br>
We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies, except when we have your consent to do so, as necessary to complete a transaction you have requested, for marketing purposes (unless you have chosen not to receive such communications, in certain business transactions), when required by law, or when permitted to protect our rights or property. The following section describes these disclosure circumstances more fully.
<blockquote>
    <p>* Your Consent. We will disclose personal information with your consent, which we may obtain in writing, verbally, through online means or as part of an agreement with us. If new services are offered in the future that require disclosure of personal information to third parties or other uses of personal information not covered in this Policy, we will update this Policy to reflect the changes.<br>
    <p>* Transaction Processing. We disclose personal information to third parties in connection with, or as may be necessary to service or process a product or service requested or authorized by you, to effect, administer, or enforce a transaction requested or authorized by you, or to maintain or service your account. For instance, we may use a third party service provider to process your transactions. These third party service providers may include financial providers, such as banks, and non-financial providers, such as data processing companies, compliance support organizations, and marketing organizations. When the third party acts solely on our behalf, we will require them to follow our privacy practices.<br>
    <p>* Internal Analysis. We may use information about you for our own internal statistical, design, or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns as well as to understand demographic, customer interest, purchasing and other trends among our users. We may outsource these tasks to third parties; however, the third parties may not use or disclose your personal information for any other purposes.<br>
    <p>* Marketing Purposes. We may disclose your personal information to third parties so they can inform you about their products or services. If you do not wish to receive these types of third party communications, you can tell us your preferences. While you may choose not to receive direct marketing information from third parties, you will continue to receive invoices, service impacting notifications and other similar information from us, electronically or otherwise, as well as general advertisements through our site (if any).<br>
    <p>* Our Affiliates. We may provide all of the nonpublic personal information we collect about you to our affiliates to enable them or enhance our ability to offer you new or additional products or services, improve the quality of the products and services we currently offer to you, and to aid us and them in the assessment of our existing products and services and the development of new products or services. "Affiliates" may include financial providers, such as providers of general business support and services, and affiliated sales and support organizations including providers of systems support and services, and compliance services.<br>
    <p>* Business Transfers. Information about our users and the site is one of our most important business assets. Therefore, information about our users, including personal information, will be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the site, our Services or fulfill products, sale or pledge of company assets as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.<br>
    <p>* Protection of BanQpay and Others. We may release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights or property, or to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, our site or Services; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.
