<p>Yggdrasil thinks that your base URL is: <?php echo BASE_URL;?></p><p>Yggdrasil thinks that you were trying to load the following page: <?php echo $this->uri->uri_string();?></p>
<p>If you haven't installed, and the above information is incorrect, that means that Yggdrasil is having problems making sense of your server's configurations. </p>
